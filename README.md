# 🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Problem Statement

Atliq Grands, a prominent five-star hotel chain across India, has been a key player in the hospitality industry for the past two decades. However, due to intensified competition and ineffective strategic decisions, the company has been facing a decline in both market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segment.

To reverse this trend, the Managing Director has decided to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence into decision-making processes. Since Atliq Grands currently lacks an in-house analytics team, they have outsourced this task to an external service provider to uncover key insights from historical data.
